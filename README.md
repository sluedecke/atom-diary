# atom-diary package

Keep a diary in Atom using markup like [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org/) or [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

This package allows you to keep a diary in atom - how great is that?  It has a nice three month calendar view for easy navigation to past entries and organizes your diary in monthly files.

- `Alt-Shift-d a`: Creates a new diary entry for the current time
- `Alt-Shift-d c`: Toggles the calendar view
- `Alt-Shift-d d`: Opens the diary as a project in a dedicated window
- `Alt-Shift-d p`: Creates a "printable" version of the diary

This package is inspired by my Emacs module [diary-private.el](http://meta-x.de/software/diary-private.el).

You might want to install the [AsciiDoctor preview package for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/asciidoctor-preview) for previewing your diary files.
